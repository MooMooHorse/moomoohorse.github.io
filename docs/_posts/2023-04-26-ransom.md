## Attack Defense Paradigm

I attack your computer based on your OS source code

I protect my computer based on your attack source code

...

Never end

`Testing Frame Work` $\rightarrow$ `Statisitcs`

OK, if system A fails at 5 different virus and system B only fails at 1, who is better? You can't tell.

---

Need an index that's independent from protection method and attack method.

* Ideal defense $\rightarrow$ no ransomware anymore
* k-lag defense, let ransomware run $k\ \micro\text{s}$ and see the destruction.

Question :

How generic should this testing framework be?

Generic meeans it's independent of variables. But what are those variables. If storage system types isn't one of these variable, then I think the way is to widely test upon GFS, XFS, mySQL, postgreSQL ...

#### How does storage systems do their journal?

* Most of the storage systems don't do data journal
* Other systems do coW, but that's per transaction, the amount of recoverable files are limited.
*

### Data backup

Generic way to defend against ransomware.

So need to study journal and logging behavior...

The most important problem is frequency because if we're under ideal defense, meaning ransom ware can be detected as soon

### Implementation

Need this tool to be portable, probably have to encapsulate the code and provide some APIs. However, the probes within BIOs should be enforced (not optional).

Ideas:

* Patch :
  * [kernel patch1](https://netkit-jh.github.io/docs/1.0.0/dev/guides/kernelpatches/#:~:text=To%20create%20kernel%20patches%2C%20firstly,use%20the%20URL%20available%20KERNEL_URL%20.&text=Once%20you%20have%20a%20.,patches%2F%20and%20name%20it%20appropiately.)
