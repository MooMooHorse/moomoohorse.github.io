## Attack Defense Paradigm

I attack your computer based on your OS source code

I protect my computer based on your attack source code

...

Never end

`Testing Frame Work` $\rightarrow$ `Statisitcs`

OK, if system A fails at 5 different virus and system B only fails at 1, who is better? You can't tell.

Need an index that's independent from protection method and attack method.

* Ideal defense $\rightarrow$ no ransomware anymore
* k-lag defence, let ransomware run $k\ \micro\text{s}$ and see the destruction.

### Data backup

Generic way to defend against ransomware.

So need to study journal and logging behavior...

The most important problem is frequency because if we're under ideal defense, meaning ransom ware can be detected as soon
