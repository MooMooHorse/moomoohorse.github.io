## Attack Defense Paradigm

I attack your computer based on your OS source code

I protect my computer based on your attack source code

...

Never end

`Testing Frame Work` $\rightarrow$ `Statisitcs`

OK, if system A fails at 5 different virus and system B only fails at 1, who is better? You can't tell.

---

Need an index that's independent from protection method and attack method.

* Ideal defense $\rightarrow$ no ransomware anymore
* k-lag defense, let ransomware run $k\ \micro\text{s}$ and see the destruction.
  * Destruction means the unrecoverable data in mapped disk(target storage region which stores targeted files to ransomware)

Question :

How generic should this testing framework be?



---

### Generic

Generic meeans the testing framework should be  independent of variables. But what are those variables. If storage system types isn't one of these variable, then I think the way is to widely test upon GFS, XFS, mySQL, postgreSQL ...

Variable can also include the type of ransomware : 

---

#### Observation 

* Current ransomware are hard to work with because
  * server might be off-line (20 / 20 aren't working when I randomly fetch ransomwares from virus set).
  * only available on windows, hard to probe
  * some ransomware destorys the system(not the entire system, just ban the other ransomwares and applications), hard to test, need to **reload** the system every time, reload windows takes ~10 minutes

---

* With working ransomware, still
  * hard to standardize, why choose this one over other ransomwares?
  * not summable (fs lost 70% data over ransomware1, 80% data over ransomware2, another file system fs' lost 90% data over ransomware1 50% data over ransomware2), which is better? Can we take sum over any data?

---

### Standardized ransomware

* Healthy : do nothing except for encryption data
* Transparent : can be adjusted for testing framework
* Working : can encryt data without the existence of server.
* Flexible : can do batch test.

#### How does storage systems do their journal?

* Many of the storage systems don't do data journal, they do metadata journal only for performance.
* Some systems do coW, but that's per transaction, the amount of recoverable files are limited.

---

### Data backup

Generic way to defend against ransomware.

So need to study journal and logging behavior...

The most important problem is frequency and expiration rate of journal and logs, I think.

### Remote storage

### Implementation

Need this tool to be portable, probably have to encapsulate the code and provide some APIs. However, the probes within BIOs should be enforced (not optional).

~~Ideas, now I don't think these are going to help~~:

* Patch :
  * [kernel patch1](https://netkit-jh.github.io/docs/1.0.0/dev/guides/kernelpatches/#:~:text=To%20create%20kernel%20patches%2C%20firstly,use%20the%20URL%20available%20KERNEL_URL%20.&text=Once%20you%20have%20a%20.,patches%2F%20and%20name%20it%20appropiately.)
  * [kernel patch2](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.15/process/applying-patches.html)
  * [kernel patch3](https://medium.com/coinmonks/make-linux-kernel-better-beginners-guide-to-writing-your-first-linux-patch-1125e4891e0d)
  * [kernel patch4](https://initialcommit.com/blog/git-format-patch)

### Windows & IO

* [Windows7 iso](https://www.softlay.com/downloads/windows-7-home-basic?download=links&opt=1)
* Windows 10 ISO should be available...

### Current obstacles

1. Don't really know how to trace journals and logs(def unable to do it in block level) in **Windows** and with storage systems that I **can't access source code**.
2. Might need to build a standardized ransomware(may need to study the repos on github a little bit)
