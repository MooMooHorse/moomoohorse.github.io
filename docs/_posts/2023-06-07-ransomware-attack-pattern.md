# Ransomware Attack Patterns & Attacked System's File Distribution

1. Operation sequence of ransomware = $N1 = 3$ 
2. R W type of each operation       = $N2 = 2$
3. Characteristics of each R W type = $N3 = 5$
4. File System Image for each attack patttern = $N4 = 27$

\# Test cases ($N$) for each storage system :

$$
N = N1 \times N2 \times N3 \times N4 = 810
$$

## Assumptions

Beause we're targeting storage system, application level difference can be omitted 

- ~~Access Control(ACL)~~
- ~~Access Time~~
- ~~File content (Entropy of Files)~~

Although real-world ransomware heavily relies on these traits, they are irrelevant to our testing.


---

## Operation sequence of ransomware

3 cases :
- Read Encrypt Overwrite
- Read Encrypt Create(New) Write Delete(Original)
- Read Encrypt Create(New) Write Shred(Original)

Ransomware Attack types [Report](https://crimesciencejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40163-019-0097-9): 

> According to (Kharraz et al. 2016) there are three ways ransomware encrypts fles: (i) overwriting originals with the encrypted versions, (ii) encryption then unlinking of the originals, and (iii) encryption and secure deletion of the originals

Detailed Explanation [paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity16/sec16_paper_kharraz.pdf)

> An attacker can use customized destructive functions, or Windows API functions to delete the original userâ€™s files. The attacker can also overwrite files with the encrypted version, or use secure deletion via the Windows Secure Deletion API.

## Rare Patterns of Ransomware

Besides sequence of Read / Write / Create / Unlink / Erase Operations, what other things can ransomware do?

---

### Corrupting MFT / Inode Table (Indexing)

> attack that encrypted the Master File Table (MFT) of victims, but did not unlock it after payment. Encrypting the MFT renders the content of a hard drive unusable, and is rarely used among ransomware families. 


This can be used to test the resilience of storage system.

- After partially corrupted disk, how much unencrypted data are there?


---

## R / W types obtained from our study

- RW continously (R W whole file)
- RW in chunks

---

### R W continously 

![center h:500 w:1100](../assets/img/posts/reovw.png)

---

- Read / Write whole file


---


### Read Write chunk by chunk

![center h:500 w:1100](../assets/img/posts/rwcc.png)


---

- Read / Write Chunk by Chunk 

---

## Characteristics of each R W type 

- **Time gaps** between a certain amount of reads / writes or a certain amount of bytes read / written 
- **sequential / random** access pattern 
- **size** of chunk / minimum R W length
- \# chunks / bytes each operation issues
- **threads** used to R W
---

### Sequential / Random Access Pattern

[paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_spring16_02_tarasov.pdf)

> First, one can specify an I/O size with the iosize attribute. Second, one can pick between sequential (default) and random accesses
- Time gaps and the threshold can be changed for a single test. (e.g.how many reads before pause / how many bytes of read before pause can be different for a single ransomware)

### Multi-threaded R / W


![center h:500 w:1100](../assets/img/posts/rwmtt.png)

---

- Multi-threaded can be turned on for a certain number of files. (Target Abibrary)
- Can be used in any of previous operation. (Operation Abitrary)
- Multi-threaded can be stopped with time gaps for a certain amount of read / write or a certain amount of bytes read / written

---

### Read / Write # files

- randomly pick k files to encrypt
- pick files with size between [l, r]

--- 

## File System Image

> The performance of file systems and related software depends on characteristics of the underlying file-system image (i.e., file-system metadata and file contents).

We use a set of FS metadata (parameters) as base, only changing 3 sets of attributes to obtain 27 sets of FS distribution.

> The snapshots of file-system metadata were collected over a five-year period representing over 60, 000 Windows PC file systems in a large corporation.

[paper](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/fast09/tech/full_papers/agrawal/agrawal.pdf)

---

### 3 Sets of indepedent attributes 

* FS used Image size  (10MB, 1GB, 100GB)
* File Size Distribution (Peak at : Small, Medium, Large Size files )
  * Peak at Small $\mu = 2, \chi_M = 50\ \text{MB}$
  * Peak at Medium $\mu = 9.48, \chi_M = 512\ \text{MB}$
  * Peak at Large $\mu = 15, \chi_M = 4096\ \text{MB}$

* Fragmentation Degree (score = 0, 0.5, 1)

---

#### More explanation on fragmentation score

> A layout score of 1 means all files in the file system are laid out optimally on disk (i.e., all blocks of any given file are laid out consecutively one after the other), while a layout score of 0 means that no two blocks of any file are adjacent to each other on disk
