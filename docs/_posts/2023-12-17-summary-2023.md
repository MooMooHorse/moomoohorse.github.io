# 2023 is ending, 2024 is about to start

70% of the content is too private, personal and aggressive. If you know me, those content possibly can make you uncomfortable so I removed them. This is not really a place to get to know me as a person (please talk to me directly and not via social media if possible). So I delete them and move them to my personal doc.

## In 2023, what have I done?

* Joined a research group (Platform X, led by Prof. Jian Huang), participated in some real projects in academia.
* Joined Microsoft, China (led by Dr. Kang), participated in some real projects in industry.
* Met some friends, in the lab and in Microsoft. Some of them are great people. I felt extremely **comfortable** talking to many of them (which is really **rare** for me because I held a very high bar on friends, people I felt comfortable to be with).
* Renewed my journey as MATH 241 -> MATH 285 TA with many wonderful people supporting me despite my poor performance.
* Finished important applications for grad school (UIUC, frankly).
* Killed some badass courses like ECE 391, ECE 411, building some basic systems from scrath (OS, processors, full-stack applications, etc.)

## In 2023, what changed me significantly?

These are **extremely short-term conclusions** (apparently;) Others are transferred to personal doc.

* LLM becomes a game changer
  * I don't like the researchers who only do AIs, at least the majority of them. 
  * Now, there is a paradigm that transforms human resources to GPU resources. In the old time, engineers are responsible for offload the human work to machines. 
  * This is a game-changer. I need to keep up with the trend. And become flexible in my choice of career.
* Studying aboard becomes a very stupid option : No significant gain.
  * With such changes, Chinese grad students are not that needed.
  * These changes will propagate much much slower in China.
  * I want to do some useful work. Unfortunately, those kinds of work in U.S. are hard to access as an international student in a limited time.

## In 2023, what did I screw up?

Completely transferred to personal doc.

## In 2024, what should I do?

50% are transferred to personal doc.

* Sleep at 23:00 regardless of circumstances
  * No one can stop you from doing this.
* Be brave. Be strategically aggressive. Reject Shame.
  * The objective is to **stay in the game** and try to aim for a victory in my life.
  * Find a **constructive** *strategy* for all the courses of my life.
  * Then I will stop caring about what other people say and stop getting too emotional about people.
  * Get myself close to those who want to fight alongside with you, despite the hardship. 
    * Some people might appear to behave like this initially, but people can change. ( **perseverance counts**)
    * For the people who are not fighters, and those who can't take risks WITH YOU, abandon them immediately and directly.

## Some Posts I Plan to Publish in 2024

### January & February

* Polish (actually write) the processor post
* Deep Speed scheduling Analysis
* Semantic Kernel Application 
* A post about courage & vulnerability

### March ~ May

* A post about my MATH TA experience
* A post about OS & file system
* A post about dopamine & neuro-science
